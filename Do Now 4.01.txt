    multi_fruit = []
    multi_fruit.append(single_fruit[0] + 's')
    multi_fruit.append(single_fruit[1] + 's')
    multi_fruit.append(single_fruit[2] + 's')
    multi_fruit.append(single_fruit[3] + 's')
    print(multi_fruit)

In your notebook
Respond to the following
Briefly write down what happened. What would happen if you added 100 items to the list single_fruit? It took an item from single_fruit and appended them with an 's'.
Write down how you would update multi_fruit.

2. In your console
Type the following
    list_of_numbers = [3, 5, 10, 23]

3. In your console
Rewrite the code from part 1 using knowledge from part 2.

single_fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'watermelon', 'grape']
multi_fruit = []
for item in single_fruit:
    print(f"{item}s")

print(multi_fruit)
[]
>>> for item in single_fruit:
...     multi_fruit.append(f"{item}s")
... 
>>> print(multi_fruit)
['apples', 'bananas', 'watermelons', 'grapes']
